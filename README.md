## Second Year - Team Project Game - Farmageddon

This is a copy of the repository for archival purposes.

I worked on this project from February - May 2021 with 5 other students at the University of Birmingham.

The game, Farmageddon, is a competitive farming game where you race other players to earn the most money. It contains many features including fully networked play, and AI with pathfinding.

Personally, I worked on 4 main sections of the game:
* The core game engine, designed as an entity-component model.
* The AI pathfinding system using navmeshes (including automatic navmesh generation)
* The particle system, which supported rendering and animating thousands of particles simultaneously.
* The renderer, which was built on top of JavaFX and supported 2.5D rendering.
